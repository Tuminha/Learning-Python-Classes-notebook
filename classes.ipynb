    "\n",
    "1. ✅ Creating a simple class\n",
    "2. ✅ Class attributes and instance attributes\n",
    "3. ✅ Methods and the `self` parameter\n",
    "4. 🔶 Special methods (magic methods) - We've used `__init__`, but there's more to discover!\n",
    "5. ❌ Inheritance and polymorphism\n",
    "6. 🔶 Encapsulation and access modifiers - We've touched on this implicitly\n",
    "7. ✅ Class methods and static methods - We've used a static method\n",
    "8. ❌ Property decorators\n",
    "9. ❌ Composition and aggregation\n",
    "10. ❌ Abstract classes and interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Our Next Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next steps in our journey, let's focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🧙‍♂️ Special methods (magic methods): \n",
    "   - Expand our `Book` class with more special methods like `__str__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. 👨‍👧 Inheritance: \n",
    "   - Create a subclass of `Book`, such as `Ebook` or `AudioBook`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Next Lesson: Special Methods and String Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 What we're going to learn:\n",
    "Special Methods (Magic Methods) and String Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏋️ Proposed exercise:\n",
    "Enhance your `Book` class by adding these special methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__str__`: For a readable string representation of the book\n",
    "- `__repr__`: For a detailed string representation, useful for debugging\n",
    "- `__eq__`: To compare two books for equality based on their title and author\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, add a method to display the book's details in a formatted way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Testing your implementation:\n",
    "Create multiple book instances, print them, and compare them to see your new methods in action!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise will help you understand how special methods can make your classes more powerful and easier to use. It also introduces the concept of operator overloading (with `__eq__`), which is an important aspect of object-oriented programming in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Ready for Takeoff!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into these magical methods and take our `Book` class to the next level! Remember, coding is an adventure - enjoy the journey of discovery! 🌟"
