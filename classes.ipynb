    "\n",
    "1. 🧙‍♂️ Special methods (magic methods): \n",
    "   - Expand our `Book` class with more special methods like `__str__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`\n",

    "# There are important differences and reasons to use __eq__:\n",
    "# Object Comparison:\n",
    "    # The __eq__ method provides a way to compare two objects for equality. Without it, you'd have to manually compare each attribute of the objects, which can be cumbersome and error-prone.\n",
    "# Consistency:\n",
    "    # The __eq__ method ensures that the comparison logic is consistent across your codebase. This is especially important when you have multiple instances of a class and need to compare them frequently.\n",
    "# Readability:\n",
    "    # Using the __eq__ method makes your code more readable and expressive. Instead of writing complex comparison logic, you can simply use the == operator to compare objects.\n",
    "# Integration with Python's Data Structures:\n",
    "    # The __eq__ method allows your objects to be used in Python's data structures like sets and dictionaries, which rely on the ability to compare objects for equality.\n",
    "# Difference from Other Methods:\n",
    "    # While methods like __str__ and __repr__ are used for string representation, __eq__ is specifically used for comparing objects. It provides a clear and standardized way to define what it means for two objects to be equal.\n",
    "# Fallback for Default Comparison:\n",
    "    # If __eq__ is not defined, Python will use the default comparison behavior, which is to compare the memory addresses of the objects. This is usually not what you want, as it doesn't consider the actual content of the objects."
